== Upgrading notes for 1.36 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.36 upgrades are below:

In 1.36 we have fully removed the wb_terms table and this will
get removed from the database when doing the update.
A breaking-change with this is that case-insensitive search
will stop working without the support of ElasticSearch.
