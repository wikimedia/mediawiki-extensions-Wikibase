Wikibase as an extension of MediaWiki that allows for the creation, maintenance, dissemination, and usage of
structured data in MediaWiki.

The Wikibase package consists of three interconnected extensions:

* Wikibase (in the directory repo)
* Wikibase Client (in the directory client)
* WikibaseLib (in the directory lib)

The repo is the extension for the repository. It allows the creation and maintenance of structured data. This is
planned to be used on wikidata.org once it is launched.

The client is the extension for the client. It allows several MediaWiki instances to use data provided by a Wikidata
instance. Usually, you would not use them in a single wiki. This is planned to be used on the Wikipedias.

The lib bundles common code that is used by both the client and the repo.

Note that in each of the directories you will also find README notes for each of the extensions.
