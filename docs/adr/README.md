This directory collects Architecture Decision Records, as outlined by Michael Nygard in his article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Architecture (understood widely) decisions should be documented in the ADR format.

ADRs related to possible changed, superseded or any other outdated decisions should NOT be removed from the directory. Superseding decisions should reference ADRs they're changing or overriding.
