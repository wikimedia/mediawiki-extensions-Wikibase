== Upgrading notes for 1.41 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.41 upgrades are below:

* (T333662) The `entity-schema` property data type,
  which was unintentionally enabled by default for several Wikibase releases
  despite being disabled as incomplete on Wikidata,
  has been removed from Wikibase.
  We expect that no other installations were using it;
  however, if you need this data type to exist
  (e.g. if you created any properties with this data type),
  you can install the EntitySchema extension,
  which now contains an `entity-schema` data type that is fully compatible
  with the one previously included in Wikibase.

= Wikibase 1.38 =

== Upgrading notes for 1.38 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.38 upgrades are below:

Wikibase 1.38 features a new change dispatching scheme, replacing the old one.
If you were regularly running the `dispatchChanges.php` and `pruneChanges.php` maintenance scripts,
you can stop doing that now (e.g. remove any such cron jobs), they are no longer necessary.
For the migration, we suggest the following procedure:

- Run `pruneChanges.php --ignore-dispatch --keep-days 30`, to remove very old changes.
  (“Changes” refers to entries in the Wikibase change dispatching mechanism –
  your revision history will be kept, of course.)
- Set the wiki to read-only mode.
- Run `dispatchChanges.php` and wait until there is nothing left to dispatch.
  (Terminate the script once it says “Idle: No client wiki found in need of dispatching.”)
- Run `runJobs.php`, including on any client wikis, to process any dispatched changes.
- Run `pruneChanges.php`, to remove changes that are now dispatched.
- Update the code of the wiki (and any client wikis) to 1.38.
- Perform any regular MediaWiki post-update steps,
  such as updating Composer dependencies and running `update.php`.
- Run `ResubmitChanges.php`, to move remaining changes into the job queue.
- Resume automatic job runners, if you have any (now using the new code).

==== New configuration ====

==== Changed configuration ====

* (client) (T293246) If you configure your own entity sources,
 and the entity source referred to by the `itemAndPropertySourceName` setting has a string as the `repoDatabase`,
 then that string must also be a site ID of the repo wiki.
 (This was true before in some setups, but is more important now.)
 If you have a single wiki that is both a repo and a client,
 it’s recommended to set the `repoDatabase` to `false`.

= Wikibase 1.37 =

== Upgrading notes for 1.37 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.37 upgrades are below:

When upgrading to 1.37 from 1.35 or 1.36 we supply a simple php script
for administrators to run before the actual update happens.
The script gives recommended settings based on the current configuration.
You can download it from https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P16814
and save it in the Wikibase folder of your mediawiki installation.

Execute it as a normal maintenance script and replace the legacy repositories
configuration with the new entitySources one.

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.37 ===

 examples. These entities will be affected by changes made through those
 examples, such as edits made by the API sandbox.

* (repo+client) (T257262) The entitySources setting is no longer optional, but required.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.35 upgrades are below:

The term storage in Wikibase has seen significant changes and has been under
migration on Wikidata from the old wb_terms table to the new normalized model
for a significant period of time.

In April of 2019 the Wikidata team adopted a migration strategy (T220480)
where the two storage models would be living side by side for the period of
the migration. The migration has happened for reads and writes which has been
controlled by a set of temporary variables that determine which storage will
be used. Since March of 2020 wikidata was set to not read from the old
wb_terms table anymore and during fall of 2020 the wb_terms table was
officially dropped (T208425) on the development branch.

The following configuration settings have been added to support this migration
on Wikidata and will be removed in upcoming releases.

* (repo) tmpPropertyTermsMigrationStage
* (repo) tmpItemTermsMigrationStages
* (repo) tmpItemSearchMigrationStage
* (repo) tmpPropertySearchMigrationStage

When upgrading to 1.35 this migration will happen primarily in jobs that run on
the repository. Therefore it might be necessary to execute runJobs.php until
the new term storage has been fully populated or by increasing the job run rate
by changing the value of $wgJobRunRate. On smaller Wikibase instances this
migration process will automatically be handled by running update.php.

Don't forget to backup your database!
