      "message": "I\u0027d swap the nesting, putting the if/then/else into a single try with two catch clauses.\n\nIn general, try/catch blocks should be as *big* (and as far up the stack) as is sensible. For instance, since each catch contains a continue, you could just wrap the entire body of the for loop in a try/catch.\n\nSince the body is big, consider factoring it into a separate function, though. The try/catch can be inside the function or outside, around the call, depending on where you have better information for reporting. In general, I\u0027d go for having the try/catch outside the function, in the calling code, inside the loop.",
